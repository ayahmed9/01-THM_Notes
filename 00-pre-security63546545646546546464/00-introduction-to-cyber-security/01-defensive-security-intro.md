# 🛡️ Defensive Security Intro
- Code-named "blue teaming"
- Key to protecting networks and organizations worldwide

## Key Areas of Defensive Security
- Monitoring & Detecting
  - Continually observing network and system activity to detect suspicious behavior and events
- Incident Response
  - If suspicious activity is confirmed and alerts are raised
    - Contain threat
    - Remove threat
    - Restore business to normality
- Threat Intelligence
  - Gathering using latest information about hackers
    - Methods
    - Targets
    - Trends
- Vulnerability Management
  - Fixing software or system flaws
    - Important preventative measure
    - Can lower risk of attack
    - Teams can check which systems are most likely to be targeted
      - Can be done manually or with automated tools
- Investigation & Analysis
  - Always monitor and analyze what's happening
  - Separate normal activity from suspicious behaviour

## Roles & Responsibilities

### SOC Analyst
- Monitors events on networks and systems
- Identifies suspicious or expected behavior
- Frontline of protecting organizations

### Incident Responder
- Investigates and responds to ongoing security incidents
- Monitors and prevents attackers in real time
- Shares lessons learned during attack to prevent future incidents

### Security Engineer
- Develops and maintains essential tools and systems for
  - Monitoring
  - Investigating
  - Exploring

### Digital Forensics
- Understands what occured during an incident
- Gathers, preserves, and analyzes evidence from network and systems
- Uncovers vital information about attackers and their methods

## 🏹 "Defence in Depth"
Organizations don't rely on a single tool or method to stay secure &mdash; they build layers of defence, much like an onion or many layers to a castle.
- If one security measure fails, there are others to rely on at various stages

### Employee Training
- Attacks increasingly target employees instead of systems
  - Training employees to be proactive in recognising attempts for things like phishing is essential
    - Phishing &ndash; when emails are sent to a target(s) purporting to be from a trusted entity to lure individuals into providing sensitive information

### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- Acts as surveillance cameras across IT
- Monitors and alerts when suspicious behaviour/activity is detected across network/systems

### Firewalls 🔥
- Act as security guards on networks
- Monitors and determines what traffic is allowed to enter network, or should be rejected

### Security Policies
- Help organizations ensure that their systems are used correctly
- Can reduce risk by
  - Blocking access to dangerous websites
  - Requiring strong passwords

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

#### Security Operations Center (SOC)
- Defensive security center for technology
- Frontline of protecting organizations
- Often operates around the clock
  - 365 days/year
- Employs variety of security professionals who
  - Monitor and protect
    - Networks
    - Systems
    - Data
  - Review alerts triggered by security tooling
  - Investigate anomalies
  - Respond to incidents

#### Security Informationn & Event Management (SIEM)
- Defensive security radar
- Central place for all data and information from
  - Security devices
  - Workstations
  - Servers
  - Etc
- Offers insight into what is happening within IT
  - Central and easy-to-access
    - Makes it easy to understand what's happening quickly and clearly
